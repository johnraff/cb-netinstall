This folder contains files created during the installation of
CrunchBang by the cb-netinstall script.
They could be useful in restoring a failed install to its
previous state, or in bugfixing.
There is also a copy of the "undo" script, which attempts to 
return the system to its original state. This is experimental, and
not expected to work 100%.

If the installation was successful and no issues occurred subsequently,
this whole folder may safely be deleted.

A folder /backup on your root file system holds backups of
system files replaced during the install.
This may also be removed if desired.
