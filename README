This is a collection of files intended to install
an identical copy of the CrunchBang Waldorf desktop environment
on a basic command-line-only Debian Wheezy system.
It will modify and add some system files, install the necessary
packages and copy configuration files into your home directory.
These changes might be reversible, but no guarantees are offered,
and all the usual caveats apply.

This is NOT an official CrunchBang install medium.
Any problems you may experience are not the responsibility of
CrunchBang, although you may possibly be able to resolve some of them
by asking other users at the CrunchBang Forums. The support thread for
this installer is here:
http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=25098
There is also a thread for discussion of bugs, improvements
or customization here:
http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=21266

This installer is intended to be run on a newly installed
system with no personal settings or data,
ie just after completing a netinstall installation of the
Debian Wheezy CORE SYSTEM ONLY.
(See "Debian Netinstall Hints" below.)

Attempts will be made to backup any data that might exist,
but please do not rely on it.

HOW TO USE

Boot into your Debian Netinstall cli system,
log in and run these commands, as a normal user:
(A fresh copy of this cb-netinstall package will be downloaded.)

wget https://github.com/johnraff/cb-netinstall/archive/master.tar.gz
tar -xpf master.tar.gz
cd cd-xfce-ja-netinstall-master
./install

The installation process will start.
Follow any prompts that appear on the screen.

A folder called .cb-netinstall-logs will be added to your home folder.
(The file ~/.cb-netinstall-logs/install.log will contain
verbose information about the install process.)
This folder may safely be removed if the installation was successful,
and no issues arose subsequently.

A folder /backup on your root file system will hold backups of
system files replaced during the install.

The script itself has been separated off from the files holding
specific data about the installation. This is intended to make
customization easier. It should not be necessary to edit "install".
Even if the script is upgraded in the future, the same config files
should still work.

FILES IN THIS COLLECTION

README: this file
install: the installation script
copyright: GNU licence statement
greeting: message to user
pkgs-manual: packages to install
pkgs-norecs: packages to install without recommends
pkgs-auto: checklist of some auto-installed packages
extra_repos: repository(ies) to add to /etc/apt/sources.list
apt-keys: commands to install necessary APT GPG keys
sysfiles1: system files to copy in before installing packages (mainly apt-related)
sysfiles2: system files to copy in after installing packages
preinstall_commands: commands to run before installing packages and files
postinstall_commands: commands to run after installing packages and files
config: sets some directory paths etc
cb-netinstall-logs: folder to copy into user's home directory
undo: an experimental script to attempt to return the system to the state it was in before running the install script

(NOTE Of the two files extra_repos and sysfiles1/etc/apt/sources.list:
If only extra_repos is present then those repositories will be added to
the /etc/apt/sources.list that was generated during the Debian Netinstall.
If only sysfiles1/etc/apt/sources.list is present, that file will be
substituted for the current /etc/apt/sources.list.
If both files are present, the user will be asked which one to use.
This allows the user to keep the mirror that was set up during the install.)

DEBIAN NETINSTALL HINTS

Installing Debian Wheezy by the netinstall CD is
similar to using the standard installer.

Two points to watch if you want to use
the CrunchBang netinstall script afterwards:

1) At the "Set up users and passwords" screen,
do NOT enter a password for root.
Type nothing and press "continue".
Do this again at "Re-enter password to verify".
Enter your own name and password as normal.
You will then be given 'sudo' permissions,
which will be needed in the script.

2) At the "software selection" stage DESELECT EVERYTHING
except "standard system utilities".
You will have a core system only, on which
the netinstall installer will add what is needed.
(Some software items will be marked with an asterisk, indicating that
they have been preselected.
Use the up/down arrows to move, and the spacebar to toggle selection.)

The netinstall download and links to documentation can be found here:
http://www.debian.org/CD/netinst/

NOTE on WIRELESS
Once the CrunchBang installation is complete, any Debian non-free
packages needed by your system will have been installed and wireless
should work out of the box. However, the Debian Netinstall CD
does not contain any non-free software and the installation
may have to be done using a wired net connection. This is preferred
in any case, as it is more stable, but if for some reason you are
forced to install via wireless there are "unofficial" Debian netinstall
images here:
http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/
These images include the non-free firmware needed for many
wireless cards to work.
